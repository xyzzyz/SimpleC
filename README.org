* SimpleC compiler
** what is it?
   this is a compiler for a simple C-like language targeting JVM
** what is it good for?
   if you want to see how a compiler targeting JVM *can* be written in
   Haskell, here you go. if you want to see how this kind of compiler
   *should* be written, then, well, let's take a sit and discuss
   what's wrong with this code...
** usage
   $ ./Main tests/Main.c

   will generate Main.class .
** license
   do with it whatever you want, i'll be happy if you let me know that
   you find it interesting (i hope you do), or that you use it (wow,
   what for?)
